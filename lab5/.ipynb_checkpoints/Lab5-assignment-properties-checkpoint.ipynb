    "# Lab5 - Assignment 5 about extraction of properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Copyright, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Faculty of Humanities, CLTL\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the LAB-5 assignment of the Text Mining course. It is about Property Extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due**: 17 Mar at 23:59\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to submit**: Please submit your assignment using Canvas (see *Assignments* -> *Lab Session Property Extraction*). Convert your notebook to PDF (in JupyterLab, this can be done by clicking on *File* in the menu bar, select *Export Notebook As*, then select *Export Notebook to PDF*)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Points**: each exercise is suffixed with the number of points you can obtain for the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment goals**:\n",
    "* Get insight into the challenges of entity property extraction.\n",
    "* Learn how to build a transparent property extraction method based on patterns.\n",
    "* Get insight into the pros and cons of two pattern-based property extraction methods.\n",
    "* Be able to run your extractors on unseen documents from Wikipedia.\n",
    "* Be able to evaluate property extractors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, the main focus lies on creating your own pattern-based property extractors. You are then going to run them on Wikipedia texts, evaluate them against gold values, and reflect on their relative performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " We recommend that you go through the notebooks in the following order:\n",
    "* *Read the assignment (see below)*\n",
    "* *Lab5-Property-extraction.ipynb*\n",
    "* *Answer the questions of the assignment (see below) using the provided notebooks and submit*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** in the explanation notebook, we had an example about extraction of properties with substring matching and with dependencies. You can use much of that code here, but make sure you make the right adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good luck & have fun!**"
